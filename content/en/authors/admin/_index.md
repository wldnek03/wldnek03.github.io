I'm Jiwoo Lee, a third-year student of the IT Intelligence Information Engineering Department at Chonbuk National University. I gained research experience in the distributed network lab last semester. Through the research, I learned the contents of network protocol and tried to solve real problems by using various tools and methodologies. I have a lot of interest in communication and network fields, and I am studying the latest technology trends and developing my capabilities as a network engineer. In the future, my goal is to contribute to increasing the stability and efficiency of communication systems and grow from a large company to a network manager and engineer.
