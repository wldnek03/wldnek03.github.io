In this project, I developed a rhythm game using JavaScript. Starting from the basics of the game, I added features and applied designs that consider user experience. The game includes various music tracks, allowing users to enjoy the fun of keeping rhythm through gameplay. 
Users progress through the game by pressing buttons in time with the music, earning points based on their timing. 
The main components include game logic, user interface (UI), and various music tracks. 
The game is visually intuitive and handles various input events, providing an immersive experience for users.

**Technologies Used**
- JavaScript
- Game Logic
- UI
- Music Tracks
